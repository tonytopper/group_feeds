group_feeds
===========

A Drupal 6 Feature that let's you create a Group Feed and relate it to an Organic Group.  Then your can place the View on a Panel and any feeds related to that group.

Your Feeds module will need the patch, http://drupal.org/node/1921788

Also the Data module's Features support is only half baked, http://drupal.org/node/1443246.  Need to create an install script that will create all the DB tables properly or at least include the SQL in here somewhere to run.
